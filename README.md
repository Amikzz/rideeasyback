## ü•á What the Project is about?

Public transportation is used widely in Sri Lanka, and due to improper management, there are problems such as heavy crowds in buses, late arrival of busses, bus races endangering the passengers in and out of the busses, etc. To address these problems and get rid of or minimize these problems by efficiently managing busses through an ICT solution we are taking on this project to increase the quality of life in Sri Lanka.
